                    <p>A market index is a composite benchmark that tracks the performance of a specific market segment or economic sector. It aggregates the value of its constituent stocks, typically calculated as a weighted average, providing a snapshot of overall market trends.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Broad exposure: Gain instant diversification across entire industries (e.g., tech, energy) without buying individual stocks.</li>
                        <li>Strategic trading: Profit from macroeconomic trends rather than company-specific news.</li>

                        <li>Volatility opportunities: React to GDP reports, interest rate releases, and other geopolitical events.</li>
                        <li>ETF/CFD access: Trade indices as derivatives without owning the underlying assets.</li>
